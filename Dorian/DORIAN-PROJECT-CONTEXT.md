### What is Dorian?
**Dorian** (formerly "Moly") is an **AI-based community marketplace** platform. The tagline is "Community Marketplace".

### Core Value Proposition
A one-stop platform connecting three user types:

| User Type | Pain Point | Dorian Solution |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|

### Two Discovery Modes

2. **DORIAN.marketplace** - Discover products from communities based on interests (theme-based)

### AI Assistant
The platform features "Dorian" - a personal AI shopping assistant that:
- Customizes the shopping experience based on user data and preferences
- Helps users find and purchase products through natural conversation
- Greeting: "Hi! I am Dorian your personal assistant, how can I help you?"
